## **üìë Notes**
- this is a [PythonSDK] mod, you **can't** install it with BLCMM
- this mod needs the [EridiumLib] in order to run
- since this is often not the case with SDK mods: yes, this has multiplayer support
- the default behaviour of the skill applies and the shield of Gaige will be shared when:
  - you don't set a Deathtrap shield
  - you equip the Deathtrap shield to Gaige
- the Deathtrap shield will lose its status when:
  - you set a new Deathtrap shield while already having one
  - you equip the Deathtrap shield to Gaige
  - you throw the Deathtrap shield on the ground
  - another character that is not a Mechromancer puts it in their inventory
- you can't set shields as Deathtrap shield when:
  - the level of the shield is too high (if you can't equip it yourself)
  - you are not Mechromancer
- other useful information:
  - this only works if you unlocked the `Sharing is Caring` skill
  - you can only set one Deathtrap shield at a time
  - you can't set a Deathtrap shield as trash or favorite (unset it first)
  - the Deathtrap shield will have another color
- the hotkey to set the Deathtrap shield can be modified in the modded keybinds
- if you have a Deathtrap shield set, you won't be able to edit your save game in the SaveGame Editor unless you rejoin the game and remove the shield status, this can't be fixed
